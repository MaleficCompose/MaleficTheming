# MaleficTheming

![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/xyz.malefic.compose/theming)

> A Kotlin Multiplatform library for creating and managing material themes in Jetpack Compose

## ü¶ø Prerequisites

- Java 17 or above
- For iOS: Xcode and iOS 13+

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

1. Get the artifact from the [central repo](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/xyz.malefic.compose/theming)
2. Set up the MaleficTheme from `xyz.malefic.compose.theming.MaleficTheme` with:
   - Direct `ThemeConfig` objects
   - JSON strings (cross-platform)
   - Resource paths (platform-specific)
   - InputStream (JVM Desktop only, for backward compatibility)
3. Read [the documentation]() for more details

### Platform-Specific Dependencies

Add the library to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation("xyz.malefic.compose:theming:1.1.2")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### API Examples

```kotlin
// Cross-platform: Using ThemeConfig directly
MaleficTheme(
    themeConfig = ThemeConfig(/* your colors */),
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// Cross-platform: Using JSON string
val themeJson = """{"primary": "#FF6200EE", ...}"""
MaleficTheme(
    jsonContent = themeJson,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// JVM Desktop only: Using InputStream (backward compatibility)
val inputStream = this::class.java.getResourceAsStream("/theme.json")
MaleficTheme(
    inputStream = inputStream!!,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// Android: Using assets with context
PlatformFileReader.context = this // Set context first
val themeFromAssets = loadThemeFromResource("themes/light.json")
MaleficTheme(
    themeConfig = themeFromAssets,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// Android: Alternative approach with helper function
val themeContent = readThemeAsset(context, "themes/light.json")
MaleficTheme(
    jsonContent = themeContent,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// iOS: Using bundle resources
val themeFromBundle = loadThemeFromResource("light.json")
MaleficTheme(
    themeConfig = themeFromBundle,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)

// iOS: Alternative approach with helper function
val themeContent = readBundleResource("light", "json")
MaleficTheme(
    jsonContent = themeContent,
    content = { /* your UI */ }
)
```
